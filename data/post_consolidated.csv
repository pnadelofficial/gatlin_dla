They care about their dogs and want to do the best by them!
","I think most of the assumptions we discussed were regarding the breeders and less about the dogs. I now know that every dog has a function and it's structure will reflec that, but I still think getting a purebred dog and being able to do shows or sports with them is a super exclusive community and you need to know someone to get involved or understand where to get a quality puppy.",I think one assumption specifically about conformation shows that was addressed is that dogs don't enjoy these types of shows. I have now seen how excited dogs are to participate and train for these and how their handlers and judges try to make it an extremely positive experience for the dog.,"I am definitely interested in exploring more about therio medicine and possibly gaining more skills in the field. I want to learn more about genetic panels and what genes may cause certain disease. At this point, I am not interested in pursuing a residency for reproductive medicine but I definitely want to be able to do TCIs and other procedures for breeder clientele!
","I think having more exposure to breeding procedures and talking to more educated views about breeding and specific breeds. We focused a ton on the good of breeders and breeding, but I would be interested to hear about what breeders and the AKC are doing to improve the health of their breeds and show the general public how they are benefitting dogs. 
","I think keeping in contact, maybe keeping the breeder facebook group active, and continuing to be invited to things like whelping or procedures so we can stay interested and connected with the breeder world!

After this selective I see that it is a very collaborative and intensive endeavor to undertake and responsible breeders aren't in it to turn a huge profit. They care about their dogs and want to do the best by them!
